A CSS processor,
 often referred to as a CSS preprocessor, is a scripting language that extends CSS by allowing developers 
 to write CSS in a more dynamic, organized, and maintainable way. Preprocessors provide features such as variables, 
 nested rules, mixins, and functions, which arenâ€™t available in standard CSS. Once written, the preprocessor code
  (written in languages like Sass, LESS, or Stylus) is compiled into standard CSS that browsers can interpret.

  Popular CSS Preprocessors
1.Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)
    .Extension: .scss or .sass
2.LESS (Leaner Style Sheets)
    .Extension: .less
3.Stylus
    .Extension: .styl

  Advantages of Using a CSS Processor
1.Variables: Define values once and reuse them throughout your stylesheet.
2.Nesting: Write cleaner, hierarchical code by nesting selectors within one another.
3.Mixins: Create reusable pieces of CSS for commonly used styles, such as button styles.
4.Functions and Math Operations: Perform calculations and use functions to dynamically adjust CSS values.
5.Code Organization and Maintainability: CSS preprocessors help developers structure and organize CSS better.
    Example: How a CSS Processor Simplifies CSS Code
 Standard CSS  

 .primary-color {
    color: #3498db;
}

.button {
    color: #3498db;
    padding: 10px 15px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    transition: background 0.3s ease;
}

.button:hover {
    background: #2980b9;
}

Sass Example

// Variables
$primary-color: #3498db;
$hover-color: #2980b9;

// Mixin
@mixin button-styles {
    padding: 10px 15px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    transition: background 0.3s ease;
}

// Using variables, nesting, and mixins
.button {
    color: $primary-color;
    @include button-styles;

    &:hover {
        background: $hover-color;
    }
}

LESS Example
@primary-color: #3498db;
@hover-color: #2980b9;

// Mixin
.button-styles() {
    padding: 10px 15px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    transition: background 0.3s ease;
}

.button {
    color: @primary-color;
    .button-styles();

    &:hover {
        background: @hover-color;
    }
}
