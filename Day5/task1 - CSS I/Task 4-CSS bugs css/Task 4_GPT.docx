Common CSS Issues and Solutions
1.Layout Problems: Elements are misaligned, overlapping, or not displaying as expected.

Solution: Use the box model inspector to check padding, margin, and border settings.

2.Unexpected Styling: CSS styles don’t apply as expected or elements inherit unwanted styles.

Solution: Inspect the cascade order and specificity of rules affecting the element.

3.Responsive Design Issues: Elements do not adapt properly on different screen sizes.

Solution: Test with different viewport sizes in developer tools and ensure media queries are correct.

4.Specificity Conflicts: Higher specificity rules override other styles unintentionally.

Solution: Inspect the applied styles and adjust the specificity or use !important as a last resort.

Step-by-Step Guide to Debugging CSS Using Developer Tools

Step 1: Open Developer Tools
.In Chrome or Firefox: Right-click on an element in the webpage and select Inspect (or Inspect Element).
.Shortcut: Press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows) or Cmd+Option+I (Mac) to open the developer tools.

Step 2: Inspect Elements and View CSS Properties
.Elements Panel: Displays the HTML structure. Hover over elements to see their position on the page and margins, padding, and borders.
.Styles Panel: Shows the CSS rules applied to the selected element, including those inherited or overridden. This panel also displays the source of each rule (line number and stylesheet).

Step 3: Identify CSS Problems
.Use the Box Model Inspector: In the Computed tab, you’ll see the box model showing the element’s padding, border, and margin. This helps identify layout issues caused by unexpected spacing.
.Check Cascading Order and Specificity: The Styles panel shows CSS properties in the order of specificity. Rules further down in the panel are more specific and override higher rules.

Step 4: Test and Modify CSS Live
.Modify Styles: In the Styles panel, you can edit, add, or disable CSS properties and see the changes live.
.Add New CSS Rules: Click inside the Styles panel to create new rules for testing. Changes won’t affect the actual CSS file but allow you to test possible solutions.
.Toggle Responsive View: In Chrome and Firefox, there’s a responsive design mode icon (a small device symbol) to simulate different screen sizes.
Real Example of a CSS Issue and Debugging Process
Scenario:

<div id="header">Header Section</div>
<div id="main-content" class="content-box">Main Content</div>

CSS Styles:


#header {
    background-color: #333;
    color: white;
    padding: 20px;
    text-align: center;
    position: relative;
}

#main-content {
    margin-top: -10px;  /* Intended to add spacing but causing overlap */
    padding: 15px;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
