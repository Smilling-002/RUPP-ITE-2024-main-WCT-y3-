CSS: The Stylist of the Web

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets,
 is a fundamental language in web development. 
 It's responsible for the visual presentation of web pages, 
 controlling everything from colors and fonts to layout and animations.
  Essentially, it's the makeup artist that transforms raw HTML into a visually appealing website.

The Role of CSS:

Separation of Concerns: CSS allows you to separate the structure (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), making your code more organized and maintainable.
Consistent Styling: You can define styles once and apply them to multiple elements, ensuring a consistent look and feel across your entire website.
Responsiveness: CSS empowers you to create websites that adapt to different screen sizes, making them accessible on various devices.
Expressive Design: With CSS, you can unleash your creativity and design stunning, interactive web experiences.
A Simple Example:

HTML Structure:

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Styled Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
</body>
</html>



CSS Stylesheet (styles.css):

CSS
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
    color: darkblue;
    font-size: 20px;
}
