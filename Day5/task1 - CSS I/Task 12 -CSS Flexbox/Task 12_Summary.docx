Summary
Flexbox makes it easy to create responsive layouts, adjusting the placement and alignment of items without complex CSS. Itâ€™s especially useful for dynamic, modern designs where items need to adapt across screen sizes. By changing justify-content, align-items, and flex-direction, Flexbox provides a powerful, flexible system for arranging elements effectively.
