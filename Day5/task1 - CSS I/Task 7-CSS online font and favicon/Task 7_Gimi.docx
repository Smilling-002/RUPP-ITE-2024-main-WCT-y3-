Online Fonts

Online fonts are fonts that are hosted on a server and can be accessed and used on websites without needing to be installed locally. This allows you to use a wide variety of fonts that might not be available on every user's computer.

Using Google Fonts

Google Fonts is a popular service that provides a large library of free fonts. To use Google Fonts in your website:

Select Fonts: Go to the Google Fonts website (fonts.google.com) and select the fonts you want to use.
Customize Fonts: Customize the font styles, weights, and character sets as needed.
Embed Fonts: Click the "Embed" button and copy the provided CSS code.
Add to HTML: Paste the copied CSS code into the <head> section of your HTML document.
Example:

HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Google Fonts Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@400;700&display=swap">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This text is using the Roboto font.</p>
</body>
</html>


Favicon

A favicon is a small icon that appears in the browser's address bar or tab. It helps users identify your website and makes it more recognizable.

To add a favicon to your website:

Create a Favicon: Create a small image file (usually a .ico or .png file) with a size of 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels.
Add to HTML: Add the following code to the <head> section of your HTML document, replacing favicon.ico with the actual filename of your favicon:
HTML
<head>
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
</head>
