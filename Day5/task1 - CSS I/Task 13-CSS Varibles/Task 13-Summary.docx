How CSS Variables Work
1.Declaration: CSS variables are defined within a CSS selector (often :root to make them globally accessible).
2.Usage: Once declared, the variable can be referenced anywhere in the stylesheet using var(--variable-name).
3.Dynamic Updates: Updating the variable value at one place in the stylesheet will automatically update all instances of that variable.
