Visual Effects of Changing Padding, Margin, and Border
Increasing Padding:

Adding padding increases the distance between content and the border, making the element appear larger within the border.
Adjusting Margin:

Increasing margin expands the space between elements, moving the .box further away from other elements or the edge of the container.
Border Changes:

A thicker border makes the element appear bolder, as the width of the border adds to the overall size of the element.
