The CSS Box Model

The CSS Box Model is a conceptual model used to understand how elements are structured and laid out on a web page. It divides an element into four main areas:

Content: The actual content of the element, such as text or images.
Padding: The space between the content and the border.
Border: The border that surrounds the content and padding.
Margin: The space between the border of an element and the surrounding elements.
Example:

HTML:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Box Model Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div class="box"></div>
</body>
</html>
CSS:
.box {
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    border: 5px solid black;
    padding: 20px;
    margin: 20px;
    background-color: lightblue;
