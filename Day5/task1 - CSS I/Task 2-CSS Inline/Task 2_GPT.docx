1. Inline CSS

Definition: Inline CSS applies styles directly within an HTML tag, using the style attribute. This method is useful for 
quick changes to individual elements without affecting the rest of the document.

Advantages:

.Good for quick styling changes or when you need to apply a unique style to a single element.
.No need to create a separate CSS file or use <style> tags.

Disadvantages:

.Not reusable; styles must be applied individually to each element.
.Can make the HTML code messy and harder to read, especially with many styles.
.Inline CSS can slow down the page if applied extensively.

2. Internal CSS

Definition: Internal CSS uses a <style> block within the <head> section of an HTML document. 
This method is beneficial for single-page websites or when you want to apply styles specific to one page.

Advantages:

.Convenient for single-page websites since the CSS is stored within the HTML document.
.Helps keep styles consistent across all elements on that page.

Disadvantages:

.Styles arenâ€™t reusable across multiple pages; each page would need its own <style> block.
.Increases page load time slightly since CSS is loaded with the HTML code.

3. External CSS

Definition: External CSS is stored in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using a <link> tag in the <head>. This is the preferred method for most multi-page websites.

Advantages:

.Keeps HTML clean and separates content from presentation.
.Styles are reusable across multiple pages, providing consistency throughout the site.
.Faster load times on larger websites, as the CSS file can be cached by the browser.

Disadvantages:

.Requires an additional HTTP request to load the CSS file.
.If the CSS file is missing, the page loses all styling.

Example HTML Page with Inline, Internal, and External CSS

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

            background-color: #f4f4f4;
        }

        .internal-style {
            color: darkgreen;
            font-size: 20px;
        }
    </style>

    <!-- Link to External CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
