Inline CSS

Inline CSS is defined directly within the HTML element using the style attribute. For example:

<h1 style="color: red; font-size: 24px;">Inline CSS</h1>

Advantages:

Simple and specific: Inline CSS is easy to implement and provides precise control over the styling of a single element.
No additional files: Inline CSS doesn't require any external files, making it suitable for small projects or when you want to override existing styles.
Disadvantages:

Limited scope: Inline CSS styles only apply to the specific element they are defined on, making it difficult to reuse styles across multiple elements.
Messy code: Using inline CSS can make your HTML code cluttered and difficult to maintain, especially for larger projects.
Internal CSS

Internal CSS is defined within the <head> section of an HTML document using the <style> tag. For example:

HTML
<head>
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: blue;
            font-size: 24px;
        }

        p {
            color: green;
            font-size: 18px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
Use code with caution.

Advantages:

Reusable styles: Internal CSS allows you to define styles in one place and reuse them across multiple elements within the same document.
Cleaner code: Internal CSS helps keep your HTML code cleaner and more organized.
Disadvantages:

Limited scope: Internal CSS styles only apply to the elements within the same document. If you want to share styles across multiple pages, you need to use external CSS.
Less maintainable: As your project grows, internal CSS can become less maintainable, especially if you have many styles defined.
External CSS

External CSS is defined in a separate file with a .css extension. The CSS file is linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag in the <head> section. For example:

HTML
<head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
Use code with caution.

Advantages:

Reusable styles: External CSS allows you to define styles in one place and reuse them across multiple pages and even multiple websites.
Easier maintenance: External CSS makes it easier to maintain your styles, as you can modify the CSS file without having to change the HTML code.
Scalability: External CSS is ideal for large projects with many styles, as it keeps your HTML code clean and organized.
Disadvantages:

Additional file: External CSS requires an additional file, which can slightly increase the loading time of your web page.
Slower updates: If you make changes to your external CSS file, you need to reload the page for the changes to take effect.
